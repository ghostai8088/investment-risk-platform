"""Perf-family run vocabulary + actors (PM-1 ENT-053 + P3-8 ENT-054 — the perf event surface).

The ``calculation_run.run_type`` FAMILY discriminators + the declared external-flow set + the run
initiators. Metric-type values live with the column vocab in ``perf.models``; ``run_type`` is
DISTINCT from every metric (the GS2 rule). The perf family hosts SEPARATE run families per governed
number: ``PORTFOLIO_RETURN`` (PM-1) and ``BENCHMARK_RELATIVE`` (P3-8, ex-post realized active return
/ TE / TD / IR — a distinct input set, so its OWN family, not a PORTFOLIO_RETURN metric). Money-
weighted / IRR is the reserved PA-0 measure (its own later family).

#: The ``calculation_run.run_type`` FAMILY discriminator for a portfolio-return run (PM-1). Distinct
#: from ``metric_type`` (``DIETZ_PERIOD``/``TWR_LINKED``). **P3-8 amendment:** the ex-post
#: benchmark-relative metrics are NOT a PORTFOLIO_RETURN metric — they ship under the SEPARATE
#: ``BENCHMARK_RELATIVE`` run family below (a different input set; OD-P3-8-B). Money-weighted/IRR
#: (PA-0) remains reserved for its own later family.
