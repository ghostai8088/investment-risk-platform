## 1. Purpose

Define the temporal model and the reproducibility contract so that any risk result, report, or limit utilization can be
reconstructed exactly, and so that corrections never destroy history. This makes BR-6 (traceability), BR-8 (scenario
versioning), and BR-9 (report reproducibility) enforceable.

## 2. Two Time Axes (TR rules)

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| TR-01 | **Valid time** (`valid_from`/`valid_to`) records *when a fact is true in the business world* (e.g., a position's as-of date, a price's market date). |
| TR-02 | **System/transaction time** (`system_from`/`system_to`) records *when the system knew it* (knowledge time). |
| TR-03 | Stateful business entities are **bitemporal**: both axes are maintained. As-of queries specify both a business date and a knowledge date. |
| TR-04 | The current view = latest `system_*`; a historical reconstruction = `system_*` as-of a past knowledge time. |

## 2A. Selective Bitemporality — Entity Classification (Ratified, AD-005)

Full bitemporality is applied **selectively**, not universally. Every entity is assigned one of three temporal classes. The
default for a new entity is **EV**; promotion to **FR** requires it to be a risk-driving input that must be reconstructable on
both time axes. Class is recorded in the data dictionary alongside the entity.

| Class | Name | Time handling | Mutability | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FR** | Full Reproducible (bitemporal) | valid_from/to **and** system_from/to | Immutable history | Risk-driving inputs needing point-in-time reconstruction of *what was true* and *what was known* |
| **IA** | Immutable Append-only | system time (event/knowledge time) | Append-only; corrections = new record/version | Outputs, events, audit, overrides — pinned by their run/snapshot, so no second axis needed |
| **EV** | Effective-dated Versioned | system-time versioning + optional effective dating | Current-state queryable with retained history + audit | Reference/master/config where context history is needed but dual-axis as-of is overkill |

### FR — full point-in-time reproducibility required
Market data (ENT-020 price_point, ENT-021 yield_curve, ENT-022 volatility_surface, ENT-023 credit_spread, ENT-024 fx_rate,
ENT-025 factor_return); positions (ENT-011); valuations (ENT-013); external/internal & shadow ratings feeding credit
(ENT-007); private NAV/appraisals (ENT-017) and commitments (ENT-015); instrument economic terms that are effective-dated
(ENT-001, e.g., coupon/maturity schedules).

### IA — immutable append-only
Calculation runs and outputs (ENT-026 calculation_run, ENT-027 risk_result, ENT-028 sensitivity/exposure, ENT-014
exposure_aggregate, ENT-030 scenario_result); versioned-immutable definitions (ENT-029 scenario_definition, ENT-036
model_assumption set, ENT-035 model_version); transactions as an event log (ENT-012); manual overrides (ENT-041); lineage
edges (ENT-042); DQ and reconciliation results (ENT-039, ENT-040); report versions (ENT-046); breach and breach actions as
append-only state transitions (ENT-033, ENT-034); audit events (ENT-045, additionally hash-chained per audit taxonomy).

### EV — effective-dated versioning (lighter)
Reference/master data (ENT-002 issuer, ENT-003 counterparty, ENT-004 identifier_xref, ENT-005 currency, ENT-006 calendar,
ENT-008 corporate_action, ENT-009 benchmark); limit definitions (ENT-031, effective-dated); security/admin (ENT-043 users/
service/agent principals, ENT-044 roles/permissions/grants — grants carry effective dates); ENT-038 data_source;
**ENT-001 instrument identity** (master attributes) and **ENT-007 rating_scale/grade taxonomy** (the EV halves of the
P1B-0 splits below).

> **P1B-0 ratification note (intra-entity splits — conform to this §2A, no AD-005 amendment):**
> - **ENT-001** is realized as `instrument` (**EV** identity/master attributes) + `instrument_terms` (**FR** effective-dated
>   economic/legal terms — coupon/maturity/call schedules, the FR clause above) (OD-P1B-A).
> - **ENT-007** splits into `rating_scale`/grade **taxonomy = EV** (P1B-1) and rating **assignments feeding credit = FR**
>   (the FR clause above; deferred to a credit phase) (OD-P1B-J).
> - **ENT-008** corporate_action is **EV** (already classified here) — status/reason history flows through the `REFERENCE.*`
>   audit trail, not an IA table (OD-P1B-B).
>
> **P1B-1 realization note:** the EV halves of ENT-005 (`currency`), ENT-006 (`calendar`/`calendar_holiday`) and the ENT-007
> taxonomy (`rating_scale`/`rating_grade`) are now built (migration 0008) — all declare `__temporal_class__ = EFFECTIVE_DATED`,
> are EV-mutable (no `irp_prevent_mutation` trigger; a `REFERENCE.UPDATE` succeeds at the DB), and carry `record_version`. The
> FR halves (ENT-001 `instrument_terms`, ENT-007 rating **assignments**) remain unbuilt — **the `FullReproducibleMixin` (FR)
> still has no first persisted user; P1B-3 is its first exercise.**
>
> **P1B-2 realization note:** ENT-002 (`issuer`) and ENT-003 (`counterparty`) — realized as 1:1 role profiles over an
> implementation-only `legal_entity` core (migration 0009) — are now built, all `__temporal_class__ = EFFECTIVE_DATED`,
> EV-mutable (in-place supersede; one physical row per logical entity; history via the `REFERENCE.UPDATE` audit), carrying
> `record_version`. They are PROPRIETARY (symmetric RLS, never hybrid). **FR is still unexercised — P1B-3 remains its first use.**
>
> **P1B-3 realization note:** ENT-001 is now built (migration 0010) as `instrument` (**EV** identity) + `instrument_terms`
> (**FR** — the platform's **first persisted user of `FullReproducibleMixin`**). The FR protocol maintains both axes
> (`valid_from/valid_to` + `system_from/system_to`): create → effective-dated supersede (close prior `valid_to`) → as-known
> correction/restatement (close prior `system_to`, `restatement_reason` + `supersedes_id` — **TR-08**), with
> `reconstruct_terms_as_of(valid_at, known_at)` proving as-of reconstruction on BOTH axes (acceptance-gated tests). The FR
> table is **NOT** append-only (no `irp_prevent_mutation` trigger — the bitemporal protocol UPDATEs the close-out columns);
> content-immutability of prior versions is service-enforced + tested. ENT-004 (`identifier_xref`, EV) is also built.
> Remaining FR users (ENT-007 rating **assignments**, market data, positions, valuations) are still deferred.

### Rationale (TR-21)
| ID | Rationale |
|---|---|
| TR-21 | Bitemporality is the most expensive pattern (storage + query complexity). It is reserved for **FR** inputs because reproducing or defending a governed risk number requires reconstructing both what was true (valid time) and what was known (system time). **IA** outputs do not need a second axis: a run already pins its inputs by snapshot, so a result is reproduced from its run, not by as-of-querying the result. **EV** reference/config needs history for audit and context but rarely needs dual-axis as-of, so system-time versioning with effective dating is sufficient. Misclassification risk is mitigated by an explicit class on every entity and review when new entities are added. |

## 3. Immutability & Correction

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| TR-05 | Result, report, and audit records are **append-only**; no in-place update or delete. |
| TR-06 | Corrections create a **new version** (and, for facts, close the prior `system_*` interval and insert a successor); the prior value remains queryable. |
| TR-07 | A correction is itself an auditable event (`DATA.CORRECTION`, see audit taxonomy) and, for governed values, flows through `manual_override` with BR-7 fields. |
| TR-08 | Restatements are explicitly flagged with a restatement reason and link to the superseded version. |

## 4. Dataset Snapshots & Versioning

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| TR-09 | Inputs to any calculation are pinned by a **dataset snapshot ID** capturing the exact record versions (by system-time) used. |
| TR-10 | Scenario definitions are versioned with saved assumptions; a scenario run references a scenario version + dataset snapshot (BR-8). |
| TR-11 | Model code/methodology is versioned in the Model Registry; a run references a specific `model_version`. |
| TR-12 | Assumption sets are versioned objects referenced by runs (not inline literals). |

## 5. Calculation-Run Reproducibility Contract (FW-RUN)

Every `calculation_run` (ENT-026) binds, at minimum:

1. Code/model version(s) (`model_version` ids)
2. Input dataset snapshot id(s)
3. Assumption set version
4. Parameters (including RNG seed where stochastic — QS standards)
5. Scenario version (if applicable)
6. Initiator (user/system/agent principal) and trigger
7. Start/end timestamps (UTC) and environment id

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| TR-13 | **Reproduction guarantee:** re-executing a run with the same bound inputs reproduces identical results within the tolerances defined in numerical_quant_standards.md (QS tolerance). |
| TR-14 | Stochastic calculations must record and reuse the RNG seed and path count to satisfy TR-13. |
| TR-15 | A result that cannot bind all of items 1–7 is **incomplete** and must not be published or used for limits/reports (BR-6). |
| TR-16 | Reports bind the `calculation_run` ids and source metric versions they were generated from (BR-9); regenerating a report version reproduces it. |

## 6. Late / Out-of-Order Data

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| TR-17 | Late-arriving data is inserted with its true valid time and the actual system time of receipt (bitemporal); it does not silently alter prior results. |
| TR-18 | If late data changes a prior business date materially, a **restatement run** is created (new run, new results), leaving the original run reproducible. |

## 7. Retention

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| TR-19 | Bitemporal history, runs, results, and audit are retained per NFR-04 (≥ 7 years; confirm per jurisdiction) and never hard-deleted within retention. |
| TR-20 | Purge after retention is itself a controlled, audited, approved action (no ad-hoc deletion). |

## 8. Reproducibility Test (QA linkage)

A standing QA control re-runs a sample of historical `calculation_run` ids and asserts identical results (TR-13). Failure is a
release blocker and a control finding (control matrix CTRL — see compliance controls).

## 9. Open Decisions

| ID | Open Decision |
|---|---|
| OD-016 | Confirm retention period(s) by data class and jurisdiction (drives TR-19). |
| ~~OD-017~~ | **Resolved (Step 1C, AD-005):** selective bitemporality — FR/IA/EV classes in §2A. |
| ~~OD-018~~ | **Resolved (Step 1C):** reproduction tolerances set in numerical_quant_standards.md §2A (ε_rel=1e-12, ε_abs=1e-9). |
| OD-019 | Confirm restatement approval authority (H-01/H-04) and notification workflow. |
