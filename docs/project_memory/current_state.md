> **HEAD `778891c`** = merge of **PR #47** (FL-1: the loadings substrate + the fractional exposure

> **Where we are: Wave 6 slice 2 (FL-1) is CLOSED** — the corrected multi-family prerequisite
> shipped: **the THIRD factor-exposure family** `risk.factor_exposure.loadings` (the proxy
> projection GENERALIZED — fractional signed multi-factor loadings) through the SAME
> `run_factor_exposure` binder via the `_EXPOSURE_FAMILIES` registry map; the **3×3 predicate
> symmetry** (each family requires exactly its predicate, all nine arms probe-pinned); **the
> coverage gate** (an unloaded pinned atom refuses the run CLOSED — no silent VaR under-count; a
> captured ZERO loading IS coverage); the **FRTB vocab** (RATES/CREDIT_SPREAD/COMMODITY minted,
> CURRENCY≡FX + MARKET≡equity aliased — names-as-vocabulary, zero capital semantics;
> `LOADING_FACTOR_FAMILIES` allow-list); 3 of 5 CURRENCY gates relaxed (scenario's TWO stay
> closed — the MF-1 two-gate inventory); ENT-019 WIDENED to public instruments
> (`private_instrument_id` = the recorded pin-serializer-key misnomer; ENT-058 = the paper v2);
> the loadings source = PA-3's OLS via the **α=1 desmoothing identity detour**; the
> **through-VaR invariance golden** (loadings ≡ proxy over the same CURRENCY weights, byte-exact);
> the **FE drift trio PAID** (proxy-weight-estimates family; residual_variance/estimate_age_days/
> model_version_id columns; the ES `z×σ ≠ var_value` cell now an annotated echo). 4-finder review
> (all Fable): **zero shipped math defects**. Allocation + proxy families byte-untouched
> (invariance regressions); the demo tenant stayed CURRENCY-only by design (the MF-1 premise).
>
> **NEXT = MF-1 planning** (Part 2.9 slice 3, the LAST Wave-6 slice): multi-family factor exposure
> end-to-end — a real equity/credit book through capture → loadings → exposure v2 → covariance →
> VaR/ES on FL-1's substrate, ending with the **TRIGGERED re-validation** that closes MG-1's
> CURRENCY-only condition (grep the 5 flagship AWC conditions for 'FL-1'). Unlocks the four blocked

## Repository
- **Project:** full-scope enterprise investment-risk platform (monorepo). NOT an MVP/POC — see `build_plan.md`.
- **Layout:** `apps/backend` (FastAPI), `apps/worker`, `apps/frontend`, `packages/shared-python` (`irp_shared`, web-framework-free), `packages/shared-ts`. Postgres + RLS, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic. Numbered governance dirs `01_…`–`11_…`; delivery docs in `10_delivery_backlog/`.
- **Remote:** `github.com/ghostai8088/investment-risk-platform` (branch `main`). **origin is now HTTPS** (`https://github.com/ghostai8088/…`; keychain-cached PAT — flipped from SSH 2026-07-09 at P3-C3 because SSH port 22 is BLOCKED on the current network, timing out; HTTPS push works cleanly. Plain `git push` now uses HTTPS + PAT — no hotspot / URL-push workaround needed).

## Latest known committed state

- **Local == origin:** yes (0 ahead / 0 behind); working tree carries only this closeout-docs refresh (branch `pa-0-closeout`, pending gated commit+push).
- **Latest CI:** **GREEN** — `c9d41a7` (PA-0, PR #8) merged as `ad3d3fe`, GitHub Actions success. Locally `make check` **1191** passed + local-PG (incl. the 7 new proxy-mapping RLS legs) + fe-check 52. Chain #98–PA-0 all green.
- **Migration head:** `0034_proxy_mapping` — advanced `0033_var_backtest` → `0034_proxy_mapping` at **PA-0** (`c9d41a7`): the ENT-019 table `proxy_mapping` (FR bitemporal — `weight` NUMERIC(20,12), `mapping_method` MANUAL v1; FKs `private_instrument_id` + `factor_id` + `supersedes_id`; current-head partial-unique `(tenant, private_instrument_id, factor_id)`); **NOT append-only** (FR close-out UPDATEs — no trigger, the factor_return precedent); symmetric FORCE RLS (NEVER hybrid); downgrade smoke (0034↔0033) cycled clean; every DDL identifier ≤ 63, asserted at import (the P3-8/BT-1 lesson made structural). **Next migration lands at the next separately-approved implementation slice.**
- **Networking note (this machine):** **origin was flipped SSH→HTTPS at P3-C3 (2026-07-09)** — SSH port 22 is BLOCKED on the current network (`ls-remote`/push time out; SSH-over-443 also fails, broken pipe). **HTTPS is the working path** (github.com, REST API, and authenticated push all fast; keychain PAT cached) — plain `git push origin main` now works, no hotspot or URL-push workaround. CI verification via the public REST API always works. A full-repo safety bundle exists at `../irp-p3-3-7c50c43.bundle`.

## Working tree (uncommitted)
- **Branch `pa-0-closeout` — the PA-0 closeout PR** (pending gated commit+push): `pa_0_decision_record.md` Part 6 (proportionate 2-finder review — no HIGH bugs; 4 folds incl. the ENFORCED CURRENCY-family scope + the correction-audit `action` convention; 2 family-wide deferrals: the FR supersede window-coherence guard, the marketdata `IntegrityError`→409 mapping) + this docs refresh (roadmap/phase-ledger/current_state/next_actions). Docs-only — NO migration/permission/audit change.

## Current active gate
**WAVE 1 IS CLOSED — `wave_1_close_review.md` RATIFIED (2026-07-09, OQ-W1C-1…6); the RATIFIED Wave-2 sequence
(`delivery_roadmap.md` Part 2.5: PM-1 → P3-8 → BT-1 → PA-0 → P3-6) is now the operative sequence.** The close:
honest audit (5 slices + 2 insertions, all CI-green; ~90 review findings folded; npm audit 0 at all severities);
deferral register reconciled (P3-3/P3-5/P3-C1 deferrals all PAID in-wave; open items trigger-based incl. P3-7
B+C); outward benchmark review; the thesis destination check answered "forward, in dependency order" — Wave 2 is
organized around the **return-series triple unlock** (ex-post TE/IR + VaR backtesting + the desmoothing substrate
share ONE missing primitive, the governed portfolio-return series → PM-1 first). P3-6 moved to Wave-2 slot 5
(pre-authorized). npm CI gate tightened high→moderate at the close; **branch protection (OD-050) ✅ DONE
2026-07-10 — `enforce_admins=everyone` + 5 required CI checks; no direct pushes to `main`, PR flow binds
everyone (P3-8 onward).** **PM-1 (slice 1) DONE — `b2445c7` + `f5e16b6`, CI #137 green; the SEVENTH governed
number, FIRST non-risk (the `perf` family). P3-8 (slice 2) DONE — planning PR #1 `4880b36`, impl PR #2 `86ef3ec`
(merge `d769f59`, CI #142), cleanup+closeout PR #3 `962974f` (merge `503a9e2`); the EIGHTH governed number
(ex-post benchmark-relative AR/TD/TE/IR, ENT-054, migration 0032). BT-1 (slice 3) DONE — planning PR #4
`3e81ef4` (merge `1da87c7`), impl PR #5 `e7b615d` (merge `868f892`, CI green); the NINTH governed number
(VaR backtesting — Kupiec POF + Basel zone, ENT-055, migration 0033); FULL 4-finder local review, 14
findings/13 folded; closeout PR #6. PA-0 (slice 4) DONE — planning PR #7 `07e5d6a` (merge `7a422aa`;
capture-first split ratified; the Okunev-White citation flagged UNVERIFIED for PA-1), impl PR #8 `c9d41a7`
(merge `ad3d3fe`, CI green); the FIRST private-asset foundation: ENT-019 `proxy_mapping` REALIZED (migration
0034); proportionate 2-finder review, 4 folds + 2 family-wide deferrals. Next: THIS closeout PR (branch
`pa-0-closeout`), then **MD-H1** (slice 4.5 — a user-ratified 2026-07-11 Part-4-rule-3 hardening insertion
paying the three bug-shaped register items: FR supersede window-coherence guard, IntegrityError→409 capture
mapping, registrar first-registration race; NO migration), then P3-6 planning (stress/scenario — the LAST
Wave-2 slice; may defer again at the close, an expected outcome) on explicit direction, then the Wave-2 close
review (incl. the PA-1 sequencing decision).**
Prior state: P3-0 … P3-5 + P3-C1 + FE-1 + TC-1 + VAR-HS-1 + P3-C2 + TD-1 + P2-7 + P3-7 + P3-C3 + PM-1 + P3-8 + BT-1 + PA-0 all complete and CI-green.
Earlier slice detail: **P3-C3**
(`1bf172b`, CI run #132 green) — a hardening CARRY-IN (not a numbered slice) paying the P3-7 ultrareview's item-A deferral: binder
adjudication consistency (`TypeError` + a `base_currency` 3-letter shape gate across var/var_hs/factor so every
binder fails-close identically on malformed pins; factor_service also gained the malformed-pin wrapper it
lacked). Test-and-binder only; NO migration/permission/audit. Items B (shared covariance adjudicator) + C
(lineage batching) formally re-deferred (record OD-E). Before it, **P3-7** (`65e6dbe`,
CI run #130 green; plan `552b954`) closed Wave-1 slice **5** — the **SIXTH governed risk number: ex-ante active risk /
tracking error** `TE = √(wₐᵀΣwₐ)` (Grinold-Kahn/Roll, daily unannualized, EX-ANTE only — ex-post deferred on
the portfolio-return prerequisite, OD-G): `active_risk_result` (ENT-027 third realization, migration `0030`,
IA append-only, 3 hard-FK provenance columns incl. `benchmark_id`); `ACTIVE_RISK_INPUT` snapshot pinning
FACTOR_EXPOSURE + COVARIANCE + FACTOR + the newly minted `COMPONENT_KIND_BENCHMARK` (FR-version pins, TR-09);
registered `risk.active_risk.parametric` v1 (code_version-only identity); run family `ACTIVE_RISK`, metric
`TRACKING_ERROR`; fail-closed adjudication (NO imputation). **The FIRST user-directed FULL max-effort
multi-agent review ("ultrareview"): 10 finder angles + 6 empirical verifiers + a gap sweep — 21 findings
folded** (incl. the run_type family/metric split, kernel-overflow→committed-FAILED, adjudication hardening
each test-pinned, and 3 previously-missing CI PG RLS steps), 3 refuted/rejected-as-designed, **3
recorded-deferred in `p3_7_decision_record.md` Part 6** (var_service V2/V5 twins; shared covariance
adjudicator; lineage batching). **Remaining Wave-1: P3-6 (stress/scenario) then the Wave-1 close review**
(planning on explicit direction). Model/effort recommendation standing rule (2026-07-08): append a
next-step model+effort suggestion to every gate briefing (Sonnet/medium for commit-and-closeout mechanics;
Opus 4.8/high for templated implementation with a shipped exemplar like P3-C2; Fable/high for novel
methodology/planning/review-synthesis — extra-high/max reserved for wave-close benchmark reviews or gnarly
debugging). Strict planning-first cadence + the gate tiers hold. **Frontend visibility: the FE-1 read-only view
EXISTS (dev-shim session, permanent DEV banner) and now ALSO surfaces VAR-HS-1 runs with zero frontend changes;
anything further (dashboards, charts, mutations, more domains) remains explicitly gated.**

## P3-7 key deliverables (closed, `65e6dbe`, CI-green run #130) — Wave-1 slice 5; the SIXTH governed RISK number (record `p3_7_decision_record.md`)
**Ex-ante active risk / parametric tracking error** (OD-P3-7-A…H; plan `552b954`): `TE = √(wₐᵀΣwₐ)` — active
weights `wₐ = w_p − w_b`, BOTH sides mapped through the ONE allocation-v1 currency-factor model
(`build_factor_index` — Barra-style symmetry); daily UNANNUALIZED; EX-ANTE only (ex-post TE / active return /
IR deferred on a governed portfolio-return series — OD-G).
- **`active_risk_result`** (ENT-027, third realization; migration `0030`): single-summary-row grain
  `(calculation_run_id, metric_type='TRACKING_ERROR')`; IA TRUE append-only; symmetric FORCE RLS; hard-FK
  provenance `factor_exposure_run_id`/`covariance_run_id`/`benchmark_id` + `benchmark_effective_date` +
  `portfolio_value` evidence. **Run family `ACTIVE_RISK` ≠ metric `TRACKING_ERROR`** (a review amendment to
  OD-F — the family hosts the reserved ex-post metrics).
- **`ACTIVE_RISK_INPUT`** snapshot: FACTOR_EXPOSURE + COVARIANCE IA-row pins + FACTOR EV pins + the newly
  minted **`COMPONENT_KIND_BENCHMARK`** (FR-version constituent pins — supersede/correction invisible, TR-09;
  pin invariance test-proven under upstream re-runs AND a benchmark restatement). Binding predicate
  `v1:fexp-rows+cov-rows+cov-factors+benchmark-set` (+ an import-time varchar(50) guard over ALL predicates).
- **Registered `risk.active_risk.parametric` v1** — code_version-only identity (NO numeric parameter);
  methodology doc `active_risk_parametric_v1.md`; `risk.view`/`risk.run` REUSED; `RISK.ACTIVE_RISK_CREATE`
  reserved-not-minted; consume-path golden **0.007211102551**; fail-closed adjudication (NO imputation:
  NULL/blank currencies, unmappable currency, zero book, Σw_b ≤ 0, coverage gaps, duplicate pins of EVERY
  kind all refuse pre-create; kernel magnitude overflow → committed FAILED, never a 500).
- **Review (Part 6):** the FIRST user-directed FULL max-effort multi-agent "ultrareview" — 10 finder angles →
  22 deduped candidates → 6 verifiers with empirical probes → gap sweep. **21 folds** (correctness hardening
  each test-pinned; 3 previously-missing CI PG RLS steps incl. two PRE-EXISTING gaps; the run_type split; the
  fexp-rows rename), 3 refuted/rejected-as-designed (kept), **3 recorded-deferred**: the `var_service.py`
  TypeError/base_currency twins, the shared covariance-pin adjudicator extraction, `_persist_snapshot`
  lineage batching. Validation post-fold: make check 1044 / full-PG 230 / downgrade smoke / fe-check 43 +
  build / diff fence clean.

## P3-C2 key deliverables (closed, `6fb1a13`, CI-green) — Wave-1 slice 3; hardening/consolidation (record `p3_c2_decision_record.md`)
The four recorded FE-1/P3-C1/P3-5 follow-ups swept in one slice; NO new governed number/entity/permission/audit code; NO migration.
- **OD-B — exposure on the shared scaffold.** `run_exposure` adopts `execute_governed_run`, RELOCATED `risk/scaffold.py`→`calc/scaffold.py` (neutral home; keeps the ratified `test_scope_fence_no_risk_imports_or_identifiers` exposure↛risk fence clean — Part 4.5). FAILED exposure runs now PERSIST `failure_reason` and keep the snapshot→run DEPENDS_ON edge; COMPLETED-path behavior byte-preserved (golden at `test_p3c2_exposure_scaffold.py`, held to the P3-C1 audit-sequence + DQ-identity bar).
- **OD-C — exposure in the FE listing.** New `exposure.view`-gated `GET /exposure/runs` + `list_exposure_runs` (`irp_shared/exposure/queries.py`, fenced to `EXPOSURE_AGGREGATE`). FE runs view SOURCE-SWITCHES per family (not a client-side merge — Part 4.6); heading is now family-neutral "Runs"; `ExposureRunSummaryOut` carries `model_version_id: str|None` (always None) for byte parity with risk.
- **OD-D — captured-input `PreciseDecimal` parity.** Every captured decimal column with precision ≥16 converted (position/valuation/marketdata/reference + `transaction.{quantity,price,gross_amount}` via the review); `coupon_rate(12,6)`/`bump_bps(10,4)`/`confidence_level(6,4)` stay plain. DDL-identical on PG; invariant pinned by `test_p3c2_precision_parity._CONVERTED` (14 cols).
- **OD-E — DQ-rule first-registration race.** `ensure_presence_rule` wraps the INSERT in `begin_nested()` + `except IntegrityError` re-SELECT — 500-on-race → clean resolve, no dangling audit (`test_p3c2_dq_rule_race.py`).
- **Review (Part 6):** full 6-finder, 9 findings ALL folded (model_version_id parity, transaction completeness, exposure golden-bar proofs, exposure PG coverage `test_exposure_runs_pg.py`, doc conformance); 2 finders clean. Validation: make check 968 / full-PG 1177 / alembic no-op / downgrade clean / fe-check 39 + build / diff fence clean (30 files).

## VAR-HS-1 key deliverables (closed, `29ae31b`, CI-green run #117) — Wave-1 slice 2; the FIFTH governed risk number
**Historical-simulation VaR** (OD-VHS-A…G; plan `ec1f582`, #116): plain equal-weight factor-based historical
simulation — `risk.var.historical` v1 registered model family (declared confidence/horizon/window/quantile-
convention; the empirical lower order statistic `k=⌈N(1−c)⌉` over pinned factor-return windows; NO distributional
assumption). Reuses `var_result` (ENT-027) via `metric_type='VAR_HISTORICAL'`; additive migration
`0028_var_historical` makes `z_score`/`sigma`/`covariance_run_id` nullable, GUARDED by a new metric-conditional
`ck_var_result_parametric_not_null` CHECK constraint (the parametric method's NOT-NULL invariant stays
DB-enforced); the downgrade is DESTRUCTIVE (deletes `VAR_HISTORICAL` rows — unrepresentable pre-0028) and RLS-safe
(disables FORCE RLS + the append-only trigger transactionally around the delete — cycled twice in both directions
with real exit codes over suite-created data). New snapshot purpose `VAR_HS_INPUT` (`SNAPSHOT_PURPOSES` member) +
`build_var_hs_snapshot` (FACTOR_EXPOSURE IA-row pins + aligned per-factor FACTOR_RETURN bitemporal window pins).
Two new endpoints (`POST /risk/models/var-historical`, `POST /risk/vars-historical/runs`); reads flow through the
EXISTING parametric VaR GET family + the FE-1 listing with **zero frontend changes**. Methodology doc
`var_historical_v1.md` carries CITED external benchmarks (BoE WP525, Pritsker 2006, arXiv 2505.05646, BIS
d305/d457 — the ratified roadmap's Part 4 rule 6, its first discharge). **Independent 6-finder review: 30 filings
folded into 16 fixes**, incl. TWO ratification amendments recorded in the record's Part 5: **OD-VHS-E tightened**
(the adequacy floor `N≥⌈1/(1−c)⌉` still permitted `k=1`, the sample minimum, at its own boundary — now
`N·(1−c)>1` strictly, 21@0.95/101@0.99, enforced at BOTH the registrar and the declared-parameter re-check — the
generic-registration floor-bypass is closed too); **OD-VHS-C widened** (the third nullable column + the CHECK
constraint + the destructive/RLS-safe downgrade, above). Kernel/binder precision fixes (the magnitude-FAILED gate
was dead code — now reachable and test-proven on both engines); registry-honesty corrections to the parametric
model's own limitation text (it no longer denies the shipped method exists). 26 backend tests (a hand-minted
adjudication vehicle now drives 16 gate probes, incl. a cross-tenant provenance regression that had silently
survived the original suite). `audit/service.py` FROZEN; zero new permissions. Full-PG **1142 passed** at
implementation time.

## FE-1 key deliverables (closed, `678a651`, CI-green run #108) — the FIRST VISIBLE UI slice; NO migration
The read-only **"risk runs & results" view** (OD-FE-1-A…H; plan `416cb1d`, #107): TWO screens — the **runs list**
(the four RISK families; run_type/status filters; has-more offset pagination via a PAGE_SIZE+1 probe; truncated
`failure_reason`; whole-row click-through) and the deep-linkable **run detail** (`/runs/:family/:runId` — provenance
verbatim in monospace, per-family result tables, a FAILED run's persisted reason rendered prominently — the P3-C1
column's designed first consumer; **decimal strings rendered byte-for-byte, never Number()** — tested with
NON-round-tripping constants). **The ONE backend addition:** `GET /risk/runs` (`irp_shared/risk/queries.py` +
router; `risk.view`; explicit tenant predicate + RLS; the four RISK run_types ONLY — `EXPOSURE_AGGREGATE` fenced
out and its request a 422; fail-closed filters; `created_at DESC, run_id` deterministic order; items-only; NO audit
on reads). **Dev-session posture:** header-shim session (`sessionStorage`; printable-ASCII validation at entry AND
on load) under a permanent non-dismissable "DEV SESSION — identity is unverified" banner; honest 401/403 states on
BOTH screens; enforcement stays server-side; SSO unchanged at P6+. **Dependencies:** runtime = react/react-dom/
react-router-dom ONLY; jsdom + @testing-library/react as dev-only test tooling (disposition recorded in the
record). Vite dev proxy — NO backend CORS. **16 review findings folded** (Part 7): 2 stale-response races; runId
URL-injection (encodeURIComponent + attack-shaped test); the has-more pager; non-ASCII session-id refusal; the
fence test re-pinned to LITERALS with the real `EXPOSURE_AGGREGATE` witness; deterministic tie-break ids; **NEW
`test_risk_runs_pg.py`** (irp_app RLS posture) + its ci.yml step; RunDetail honest 401/403; row-click navigation
(the user caught this live); strengthened proofs (path pins, DOM order, pager click-through, all four families).
`apps/frontend/README.md` = the verified demo run-book (uvicorn + vite + a TESTED seeding snippet). 12 + 2 backend
tests, 37 frontend tests. **Recorded follow-ups:** the vite5/vitest2 toolchain major-bump slice (+ production-deps
`npm audit` in CI); exposure runs in the listing (`exposure.view` family).

## P3-C1 key deliverables (closed, `0599f7f`, CI-green run #105) — the hardening/consolidation slice; NO new governed number
The deferral-register paydown (OD-P3-C1-A…H; plan `c2e85ac`, CI #104): **(B) the REGISTERED-status bind** —
`assert_model_version_of` (the risk-family gate all four binders route through) now requires
`version.status == "REGISTERED"` → `UnregisteredModelError`; AND (the review's principal fold) **all FOUR governed
registrars refuse a non-REGISTERED same-label twin** (`WrongModelVersionError` 422) — register/run consistency (the
generic resolver + P7 validation semantics untouched). **(C) persisted `calculation_run.failure_reason`** (additive
Text; migration `0027_run_failure_reason`; `update_run_status(failure_reason=)` persists on the FAILED transition
ONLY; the audit payload UNCHANGED — DQ rows remain the durable evidence; the four GET-run endpoints surface it; all
four binder reason formats preserved VERBATIM). **(D) the run-scaffold extraction** —
`calc/scaffold.py::execute_governed_run` (**relocated from `risk/scaffold.py` at P3-C2** so exposure could adopt it
without crossing the one-way exposure↛risk fence; create_run → RUNNING → DEPENDS_ON → compute → fail-closed gate →
FAILED+reason | rows+ORIGIN+COMPLETED) consumed by all four risk binders AND exposure under the R0
behavior-preservation bar, **proven
by golden captures written green PRE-extraction** (`test_p3c1_scaffold_preservation.py`: audit sequences + lineage
CONTENT + DQ-rule CONTENT + exact reason formats; one finder re-ran the goldens against the stashed pre-extraction
code). **(E) `PreciseDecimal` parity** for the 8 float53-unsafe result columns (`sensitivity_value(28,12)`,
`loading(20,12)`, `exposure_amount(28,6)`×2, `signed_quantity(28,8)`, `mark_value(20,6)`, `fx_rate(28,12)`,
`z_score(20,12)` — the review fold); PG DDL identical, NO migration. **(F) the MRO-walking `deps.map_refusal`**
shared by the risk/exposure/snapshot routers (a subclass of a mapped refusal no longer 500s). **(G) both-modes
ambiguity refusal ×5 binders** covering EVERY build-mode argument incl. the as-of args (exposure's `base_currency`
deliberately excluded — verified honored on the snapshot path); checks sit BEFORE the model gate (request-shape
first). **(H) the P3-3 mixed-base adjudication check** (`_adjudicate_pins` base-currency uniformity — the latent
hole closed at adjudication, grain unchanged). **12 review findings folded; 1 residual recorded** (the DQ-rule
first-registration race — pre-existing, faithfully preserved; a deliberate-behavior-change slice if wanted).
**Recorded follow-ups:** exposure-family scaffold/`failure_reason` adoption; captured-input-table PreciseDecimal
parity. 1111 PG-backed tests; `audit/service.py` FROZEN; zero new permissions/audit codes/entities.

## P3-5 key deliverables (closed, `5ed8271`, CI-green run #102) — ENT-027 REALIZED; the FIRST derived-of-derived number
**`var_result`** (**ENT-027 `risk_result` REALIZED**; migration `0026_var`; **IA TRUE append-only** + P0001 trigger +
symmetric RLS): zero-mean delta-normal 1-day parametric VaR — `σ_p = √(xᵀΣx)`, `VaR = z·σ_p` — over the pinned
result rows of TWO upstream governed runs (`x` = a COMPLETED FACTOR_EXPOSURE run's per-factor totals; `Σ` = a
COMPLETED COVARIANCE run), the platform's first SINGLE-SUMMARY-ROW result (grain `(calculation_run_id,
metric_type)`; `VAR_PARAMETRIC`, ES reserved) with **hard-FK provenance columns** `exposure_run_id`/
`covariance_run_id` (re-resolved own-tenant on BOTH paths pre-create — PG FK checks bypass RLS; the review's
principal fold). **Declared-parameter version identity** (OD-P3-5-D): confidence/horizon/z are strict-parsed
`model_assumption`s (vocab {0.9500, 0.9900}; dual-verified 12dp z constants; horizon must equal `1` verbatim; NO
runtime inverse-CDF). Fail-closed adjudication on BOTH paths: coverage (exposure factors ⊆ covariance factors, NO
zero-variance imputation), single-run provenance, uniform base currency, canonical-order + duplicate refusals,
source-column magnitude envelopes, structurally-malformed-content 422s. The declared radicand quantization floor
(`tol = F²·max(xᵢ²)·1e-19`; clamp within, committed FAILED below — REACHABLE and test-proven) + a magnitude gate
(σ beyond Numeric(28,6) ⇒ FAILED, never a PG overflow 500). σ/VaR carried as `PreciseDecimal(28,6)`. Dual-path
verification: exact hand references (σ=500/700/7) through the kernel AND the governed consume path; `numpy`
cross-check @1e-9; erf round-trip + bisection of the z constants; NON-VACUOUS pin invariance (upstream supersede
moves a fresh build but not the pin). `RISK.VAR_CREATE` reserved-not-emitted; **`risk.*` REUSED — zero new
permissions**; `var_parametric_v1.md` methodology (**specific-risk = 0 the first-class limitation**); 4 endpoints;
the VaR PG CI step; 52 new tests. **13 review findings folded; 2 recorded deferrals** (the
`assert_registered_model_version` status-bind check — cross-slice, a P3-6-planning carry-in; shipped result-column
float parity — a dedicated PreciseDecimal parity slice) — **both PAID DOWN at P3-C1 (`0599f7f`)**. **REQ-MKT-001 → In-Progress (parametric leg);
historical-sim + MC = user-directed ROADMAP method slices.**

## P3-4 key deliverables (closed, `c2bd126`, CI-green run #99) — the THIRD governed RISK number REALIZED
**`covariance_result`** (**ENT-051 `covariance_matrix` MINTED** — the Part-3 process; migration `0025_covariance`;
**IA TRUE append-only** + P0001 trigger + symmetric RLS): the equal-weighted UNBIASED (N−1) sample covariance of
pinned `SIMPLE`/`DAILY` factor-return windows — one row per canonical unordered pair INCL. the diagonal (the
variances; `F·(F+1)/2` rows per run); grain `(calculation_run_id, factor_id_1, factor_id_2)` with binder-enforced
lowercase-GUID canonical ordering (no CHECK). **Window-as-version-identity** (OD-P3-4-G): `window_observations=N`
is a `model_assumption` on the registered `risk.covariance.sample` v1 (strict-digit parse; a malformed/absent
declaration = `WrongModelVersionError` 422; same-label different window/code_version = 409). Snapshot pins:
`COMPONENT_KIND_FACTOR_RETURN` MINTED (per-date **bitemporal** version pins — the review fix; the frozen header
cutoffs reproduce the pin under backdated/future-effective supersedes) + `PURPOSE_COVARIANCE_INPUT` +
`build_covariance_snapshot` (fail-closed common-date alignment — no imputation/pairwise). `run_covariance` mirrors
the hardened P3-3 shape: uniform pre-create adjudication of PINNED content on BOTH paths (<2 series / wrong-N /
misaligned / unpaired / non-SIMPLE/DAILY / duplicate-series all refuse before any run); defensive post-compute DQ
gate (`risk.covariance.completeness`); DEPENDS_ON-before-gate; per-row ORIGIN. **New portable `PreciseDecimal`
type** (`db/types.py`): PG `NUMERIC(38,20)` / SQLite fixed-scale TEXT (a 20dp value does NOT survive SQLite's
float roundtrip; bind-quantize inside a WIDE localcontext; −0 normalized). Kernel: pure Decimal-50, HALF_UP-20,
PSD by Gram construction; **the dual-path verification rule's first discharge** (hand-derived rational references
= kernel = `numpy.cov(ddof=1)` at ε_rel 1e-9; eigenvalue floor λ_min ≥ −1e-12·trace; numpy TEST-ONLY,
runtime-fenced). `RISK.COVARIANCE_CREATE` reserved-not-emitted @ EVT-220; **`risk.view`/`risk.run` REUSED — zero
new permissions**; `covariance_sample_v1.md` methodology; 4 endpoints; the Covariance PG CI step; 57 new tests.
**12 review findings folded** incl. a cross-slice catch: the P3-3 PG hybrid-set probe was VACUOUS (wrong
SYSTEM_TENANT_ID) — both PG suites now probe the real id + assert set EQUALITY. Deferred (recorded): shrinkage/
EWMA/correlation/annualization (v2 versions); max-lookback bound; asset-level covariance; run-scaffold extraction.
**R0 pre-step** (`a9b6567`, CI #98): behavior-preserving extraction of the shared DQ presence-gate helpers
(`dq/gates.py`) + `_persist_snapshot` — the 3×-snapshot-assembly / 4×-DQ-gate duplication debt paid pre-slice.

## P3-3 key deliverables (closed, `7c50c43`, CI-green run #95) — the SECOND governed RISK number REALIZED
**`factor_exposure_result`** (ENT-028 family — **no new canonical id**; migration `0024_factor_exposure`; **IA TRUE
append-only** + P0001 trigger + symmetric RLS; grain `(calculation_run_id, portfolio_id, instrument_id, factor_id)`;
`factor_id` deliberately NOT a hard FK — the `COMPONENT_KIND_FACTOR` pin is authoritative). **Allocation v1:**
indicator loading (= 1, quantized to the Numeric(20,12) quantum) over the pinned atoms of a COMPLETED
`exposure_aggregate` run × pinned CURRENCY-family `factor` definitions, matched on the atom's captured
`mark_currency`; contributions sum to the pinned total **exactly (ε=0)** — **REQ-MKT-003 → In-Progress (partial)**.
`run_factor_exposure` mirrors the P3-1 exemplar + the review hardenings: **uniform pre-create adjudication of PINNED
content on BOTH entry paths** (zero-atom / zero-factor / wrong-family / NULL-scope / duplicate-currency snapshots
refuse before any run exists); **model-identity assert** `assert_model_version_of` (a sensitivity model_version
cannot drive a factor-exposure run — twin-fixed into `run_sensitivities`); **conflict-safe model registration**
(`ModelVersionConflictError` → 409; twin-fixed); gap-naming `failure_reason` on FAILED runs; snapshot
`COMPONENT_KIND_EXPOSURE` (the first IA pin flavor) + `COMPONENT_KIND_FACTOR` + `PURPOSE_FACTOR_EXPOSURE_INPUT` +
a truthful `FACTOR_EXPOSURE_BINDING_PREDICATE`; `RISK.FACTOR_EXPOSURE_CREATE` reserved-not-emitted @ EVT-220;
**`risk.view`/`risk.run` REUSED — zero new permissions**; `factor_exposure_allocation_v1.md` methodology + governed
`register_factor_exposure_model`. **ci.yml restored to the COMPLETE per-table PG suite set** (benchmark, holdings,
synthetic, sensitivity, factor, factor-exposure — six suites absent from CI since the P2-5-era list; #95 ran all
green). 60 new tests incl. 8 review-regression tests; the snapshot→exposure import boundary fenced (function-local
models-only — module-level is a proven circular import). `COMPONENT_KIND_FACTOR_RETURN` was still unminted at
P3-3 close (MINTED at P3-4, its designed first consumer). `audit/service.py` FROZEN. Deferred (recorded): vendor-beta/regression exposures;
ASSET_CLASS+ dimensions; `_ERROR_MAP` exact-type lookup; both-modes silent snapshot preference; latent mixed-base
grain; GET `failure_reason` persistence; the 3×-snapshot-assembly / 4×-DQ-gate / 3×-run-scaffold extractions
(a dedicated cleanup slice — a P3-4 planning carry-in).

## P3-2 key deliverables (closed, `402cb12`, CI-green run #89) — captured factor-return inputs REALIZED
Net-new **`factor` EV definition** (canonical id MINTED; identity `(tenant, factor_code, factor_source)`; `factor_family`
{STYLE, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY, MACRO, MARKET, CURRENCY, OTHER}; optional `factor_type`/`region`/`currency_code`/`asset_class`
scope; `frequency` DAILY v1; `REFERENCE.CREATE`/`UPDATE`-audited) **+ `factor_return` FR bitemporal captured series**
(ENT-025; grain `(tenant, factor_id, return_date, return_type)` current-head partial-unique; `return_value` decimal
fraction `Numeric(20,12)`; `return_type` SIMPLE (LOG reserved); capture/supersede/correct + both-axes
`reconstruct_factor_return_as_of`; `MARKET.FACTOR_RETURN_CREATE`/`_UPDATE`/`_CORRECTION`-audited). Migration
`0023_factor_return` — symmetric tenant RLS (never hybrid), **NEITHER table append-only**. `marketdata/factor.py` binder;
VENDOR_FACTOR ORIGIN lineage; **`marketdata.view`/`.ingest` REUSED** (no `factor.*` permission); binder-side
`Decimal.is_finite()` guard (NaN/±Inf rejected pre-write) + `> -1` economic-sanity DQ RANGE; 8 endpoints; 39 factor tests.
**Captured INPUT — NO `calculation_run`, NO `model_version`, NO snapshot pin** (computed factor returns DEFERRED — would
need adjusted prices + a registered model_version). `COMPONENT_KIND_FACTOR_RETURN` readiness-noted (MINTED at P3-4).
`audit/service.py` FROZEN. Validated green on Python 3.12 + 3.14 + full PG.

## P3-1 key deliverables (closed, `e8e2e59`, CI-covered at run #89) — the FIRST governed RISK number REALIZED
ENT-028 **`sensitivity_result`** (migration `0022_sensitivity`; **IA TRUE append-only** — `APPEND_ONLY_TABLES` + P0001
trigger + ORM guard; symmetric RLS) — **curve-node analytic DV01 / spread-DV01** (`−T·DF·1bp`; ACT/365F; continuous
compounding; nodes-only/no-interpolation; ZERO_RATE/DISCOUNT_FACTOR/SPREAD; PAR_RATE rejected/deferred;
`quantize_HALF_UP(…,12)`; curve-intrinsic — NO instrument/position attribution). **The model-governance hardening:**
`run_sensitivities` calls **`assert_registered_model_version` in the pre-create gate** (fail-closed ⇒ zero run/rows/audit)
— **CTRL-003 inventory-before-use is EXECUTABLE**; the model registered via governed `register_sensitivity_model`
(`risk.sensitivity.analytic` v1; `methodology_ref` → `05_analytics_methodologies/sensitivities_analytic_v1.md`;
assumptions/limitations mirrored; `validation_status` UNVALIDATED, non-enforcing until P7). New `irp_shared/risk/` package
(`models`/`kernel`/`service`/`events`/`bootstrap`) + `api/risk.py`; snapshot `COMPONENT_KIND_CURVE` +
`PURPOSE_SENSITIVITY_INPUT` + `curve_content` + `build_curve_snapshot`; **`risk.view`/`risk.run` MINTED** (auditor_3l in
`.view`); `RISK.SENSITIVITY_CREATE` **reserved-not-emitted** @ EVT-220; `CALC.RUN_*` reused; lineage `snapshot
--DEPENDS_ON--> run --ORIGIN--> result` (DEPENDS_ON recorded BEFORE the DQ gate); fail-closed
`risk.sensitivity.completeness` DQ; the methodology framework + first methodology doc. `audit/service.py` FROZEN.

## P3-0 key decisions (ratified, `07607a5`, CI-green run #87) — the P3 contract
OD-P3-0-A…N + the OQ-P3-0-1…10 sign-offs: **analytic-sensitivities-first** (NOT VaR/ES); the **derived-number output
contract** (every official risk result binds `dataset_snapshot` + `calculation_run` + a **registered `model_version`**
where a model applies + `code_version` + `environment_id`; IA append-only; snapshot-only compute; reproducible under
correction; pre-create-refusal / post-create-FAILED failure model); **`code_version`-only reserved for convention-free
transforms** (the P2-3 rollup — sole precedent); the methodology home `05_analytics_methodologies/` + the §-template;
`RISK.*` reserved @ EVT-220 + `CALC.RUN_*` reuse; `risk.view`/`risk.run` reservation; component kinds minted additively
per consumer; risk results IA append-only; validation-workflow enforcement deferred to P7; the captured-data gap register
(vol surface / adjusted prices / ratings / benchmark levels — later-subphase prerequisites only). Subphase map P3-1…P3-7
in `p3_implementation_plan.md` (sequencing a recommendation, not a strict chain; VaR/ES last; stress RTM-P5).

## P2 captured market-data foundation — COMPLETE (CI-green)
The full reproducibility-first P2 block is delivered and CI-green: **P2-1** `dataset_snapshot` (`3629baa`, the AD-014 reproducibility
primitive) · **P2-2** `fx_rate` (`c257e5c`, captured FX) · **P2-3** `calculation_run`+`exposure_aggregate` (`da178fc`, the first
governed derived number — MARKET_VALUE only) · **P2-4** `price_point` (`2b63b76`, captured prices) · **P2-5** `curve`+`curve_point`
(`49ca3bd`, captured curves) · **P2-6** `benchmark`+`benchmark_constituent` (`b6284a4`, captured benchmarks). The reproducibility
primitive + the captured market-data inputs (FX, prices, curves, benchmarks) + the first governed derived number (exposure) are all
realized. **NO risk analytics yet** — VaR/ES/factor/covariance/stress/scenario/attribution/tracking-error stay **P3+**.

## Next required action
**THE RATIFIED ROADMAP SEQUENCE** (`10_delivery_backlog/delivery_roadmap.md`, Wave 1 — the sequence replaces the
per-slice option menu; re-sequencing only via its Part 4 rules): **TC-1 ✅ DONE (`c34b346`, #112)** → **VAR-HS-1 ✅
DONE (`29ae31b`, #117)** → **P3-C2** hardening bundle → **P2-7** benchmark price/level capture → **P3-7**
benchmark-relative → **P3-6** stress/scenario → the Wave-1 close review + re-baseline. Each slice still gets its
own decision record + plan + OQ ratification + adversarial review + Tier-2 commit approval, and starts only on
explicit direction. **Next concrete step: P3-C2 (the hardening bundle) planning, on direction — a templated
consolidation slice (the P3-C1 exemplar); recommend Opus 4.8/high per the model/effort standing rule.** Genuine
ambiguity inside a slice → ask the user with a recommendation attached (their standing rule, 2026-07-08).

## What MUST NOT be started yet
- **No next-slice implementation** — not until its planning is committed + ratified AND the user directs it (the planning itself also awaits explicit direction; see "Next required action").
- **No ES / Monte-Carlo implementation** — ROADMAP method slices (user-directed), each its own registered model family/version + planned slice; the ES closed-form seam (`σ·φ(z)/(1−α)`) stays a recorded seam (now with a hist-sim leg noted too); historical simulation is DONE (VAR-HS-1, `29ae31b`).
- **No multi-horizon √h scaling / component-marginal VaR / backtesting / runtime quantile function** — recorded P3-5 + VAR-HS-1 deferrals (backtesting is also a named later slice, a P7 prerequisite).
- **No FHS/volatility-filtered or BRW/time-weighted historical-VaR variants** — recorded v2 model versions of `risk.var.historical` (need a declared volatility model — EWMA/GARCH), never silent extensions.
- **No shrinkage / EWMA / correlation output / annualization / asset-level covariance** — recorded v2 `model_version`s of the covariance family, never silent extensions.
- **No stress testing / scenario analytics** — P3-6 (ENT-029/030; RTM-P5 — possibly a later phase).
- **No benchmark-relative analytics / active risk / tracking error / performance attribution** — P3-7+ (and `benchmark_level`/`benchmark_return` are themselves DEFERRED captured inputs — a net-new canonical ENT id, not minted).
- **No vendor-beta or regression factor exposures** — deferred v2 (need a captured factor-loading slice / adjusted-price return history + estimation); **no computed factor returns** (need adjusted prices + a registered model_version); `COMPONENT_KIND_FACTOR_RETURN` MINTED at P3-4 for the covariance window pin (regression v2 stays deferred).
- **No instrument/position key-rate DV01 / interpolation / bootstrapping / pricing engine / PAR_RATE / vol surface** — the P3-1 deferrals stand.
- **No frontend EXPANSION** unless explicitly approved — FE-1 shipped the read-only runs/results view (`678a651`); dashboards, charts, exports, mutations from the UI, additional domain screens, and any softening of the DEV-banner posture each gate on their own planned slice. No reporting build.
- **No limits/breach, real SSO, ABAC enforcement** — P6+ (ABAC stays anchored-not-enforced).
- **P1B-5** (reference-data ingestion mapping) — conditional/deferred (only if bulk loading is needed; not now).
- **Never** modify `packages/shared-python/src/irp_shared/audit/service.py` (frozen) or `entitlement/bootstrap.py` outside the governed R-07 mint (P3-3 mints NO new permission — `risk.view`/`risk.run` are REUSED); no new audit code / permission / role / migration without R-07. **No weakening of the P2/P3 snapshot-run-model controls; no BYPASSRLS; no hybrid/SYSTEM_TENANT behavior** beyond the closed 5-table set.

## Housekeeping / security (RESOLVED — recorded for recovery)
- A **plaintext GitHub PAT file** was observed in the **parent directory** (one level ABOVE the repo root, OUTSIDE version control — never staged/tracked). The user **deleted the file** and **revoked the token** on GitHub (2026-06-22), and migrated git auth to an **SSH key** (ed25519, passphrase cached in the macOS Keychain; `origin` switched to `git@github.com`). **Standing rule: never read/copy/print/use any credential file found on disk — flag it for the user to revoke/rotate. Do NOT inspect token contents.**

## Re-check at session start (may have drifted)
- **2026-07-14 pointer (PA-4 closeout):** the OPERATIVE executed ledger is `10_delivery_backlog/delivery_roadmap.md` (Waves 1–4 rows + the dated log table) — the per-slice narrative below this file's Wave-2 era is intentionally not duplicated here. Main HEAD ≥ `8ef70db6` (PA-4, **PR #30**); migration head **`0038_var_residual_variance`** (thirteen governed numbers; the chain since this file's last deep refresh: `0036` PA-1 desmoothing, `0037` PA-3 proxy-weight estimates, `0038` PA-4 residual variance).
- **Delivery autonomy (2026-07-12, EXTENDED 2026-07-14):** Claude self-drives plan→implement→review→commit→push AND **opens + merges the PRs** (the adversarial review + `make check` + full-PG + CI-to-green gates replace the human merge gate; branch protection's required checks stay on; PR create/merge via the GitHub REST API with the keychain credential). The USER still signs off Tier-3 decisions and genuine design forks. The older "USER opens+merges" statements below are superseded — as are ALL stale HEAD/migration-head/governed-number-count claims elsewhere in this file that predate this pointer (e.g. the PA-0-era "0034" / `ad3d3fe` lines above): where this pointer and older text disagree, the pointer + the roadmap win (Wave-4 close audit fix).
- `git log -1 --oneline` and `git status --short` — confirm main HEAD and branch state.
- Latest CI conclusion for the current HEAD (GitHub Actions; `gh` CLI is NOT installed — the public repo REST API answers unauthenticated, 60 req/hr).
- `git remote -v` — origin is HTTPS (`https://github.com/ghostai8088/…`; flipped from SSH at P3-C3 — port 22 blocked).
- `project_state.yaml` is **RETIRED** (2026-07-06 stub; found drifted at the P3-3 planning session) — the recovery set is `CLAUDE.md` + this file + `phase_status.md` + `next_actions.md`.
- **This machine's environment (verified 2026-07-07):** the repo sits nested at `~/Projects/investment_risk_platform/investment-risk-platform/`; the venv is **Python 3.13.0** (CI runs 3.12); **`irp_pg_local` IS stood up** (reused `postgres:16`; `postgresql+psycopg://irp:irp@localhost:5432/irp`) — reset the schema between full PG pytest runs and NEVER manually grant `irp_ops` schema USAGE (migrations re-grant; the extra grant breaks the downgrade smoke); `gh` is not installed (use the public REST API).
